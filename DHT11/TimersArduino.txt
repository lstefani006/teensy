Timer 0 - 8bit
	usato da Arduino per delay(), millis()

Timer 1 - 16bit
	usato da Arduino Servo library

Timer 2 - 8bit
	usato da Arduino tone()

Timer3/4/5 - 16
	NON per il 328P - solo i ATmega1280/2560

==================================================

The 8-bit timer is pretty simple: 
The timer clock (from System Clock, prescaled System Clock or External Pin T0) 
counts up the Timer/Counter Register (TCNT0). 
When it rolls over (0xFF -> 0x00) the Overflow Flag is set and 
the Timer/Counter 1 Overflow Interrupt Flag is set. 
If the corresponding bit in TIMSK (Timer Interrupt Mask Register) is set 
(in this case the bit is named "TOIE0")
and global Interrupts are enabled, the micro will jump to the corresponding 
interrupt vector.
