 *  \par Purpose
 *
 *  Methods and definitions for an internal timer.
 *
 *  Defines a common and simpliest use of timer to generate delays using PIT
 *
 *  \par Usage
 *
 *  -# Configure the System Tick with timer_configure() when MCK changed
 *     \note
 *     Must be done before any invoke of timer_wait(), or timer_sleep()
 *  -# Uses timer_wait to actively wait according to your timer resolution.
 *  -# Uses timer_sleep to passively wait ccording to your timer resolution.
