 /**
 * @mainpage RF24Ethernet library: TCP/IP over RF24Network
 *  
 * @section Overview Overview
 *
 * The RF24Ethernet library was initially designed as an experiment and potential testing tool for <a href = http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Network_Dev/RF24Network > RF24Network </a>, an OSI Layer 3 network driver, allowing a Raspberry Pi to
 * act as a TCP/IP gateway or host for connected sensor nodes. An Arduino can interface with any Linux machine or SLIP capable device supporting USB, or
 * preferably, an RPi runs companion software, <a href="http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Gateway/">RF24Gateway</a>, which creates a network interface linked to the RF24 radio network. This interface can be
 * further linked to the local network or internet. This allows the RPi or Arduino-based gateway to perform automatic discovery and routing of TCP/IP data,
 * with no required pre-configuration or interaction from the user beyond assigning appropriate addresses to the nodes initially.
 * 
 * @section What What does it do?
 *
 * RF24Ethernet creates a network of internet enabled RF24/Arduino sensors. It provides an API and interface very similar to the Arduino Ethernet library,
 * to allow sensor nodes to connect out to local or internet based devices to retrieve or send information, or be connected to from the internet or your
 * local network directly.  
 * 
 * Sensor nodes can act as individual web servers, simple command-and-control servers, or can connect out as required via TCP/IP. 
 * <img src="tmrh20/RF24EthernetOverviewImg.jpg" alt="RF24EthernetImage" style="width:70%;height:70%">
 *
 * @section How How does it work?
 *
 * RF24Ethernet utilizes the UIP TCP/IP stack, allowing Arduino devices to use a Raspberry Pi running <a href="http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Gateway/">RF24Gateway</a> or Arduino
 * as a gateway to your network or the internet, or simply as a repository for sensor information. The RF24, RF24Network and optionally RF24Mesh libraries
 * handle the underlying routing, addressing etc. so users do not need to be familiar with the radio modules or libraries.  
 *  
 * RF24Network addresses need to be assigned as MAC addresses, and IP addresses can be configured as desired by the user. The master node (00) uses
 * either the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) or RF24Mesh to find the appropriate nodes when IP traffic is sent though, and routes traffic to the correct
 * RF24Network address.
 * 
 * This provides a fairly seamless interaction, since users only need to configure standard IP forwarding and firewall rules as desired.
 *
 * The RF24 libraries are based on the <a href = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model > OSI model</a>:<br>
 * | System                 | OSI Layer              | Description |
 * |------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | <b>NRF24L01 Radio Modules</b> | OSI Layer 1 (Physical) | Transmission and reception of the raw bit stream over the physical medium. |
 * | <b>RF24 Core Radio Driver</b> | OSI Layer 2 (Data Link)| Transfer of data frames over the physical link. Establish/Terminate logical links between nodes. Manage acknowledgements, error checking |
 * | <b>RF24Network</b>            | OSI Layer 3 (Network)  | Routing, subnets, subnet traffic control, logical-to-physical address mapping, frame fragmentation/reassembly.|
 * | <b>RF24Ethernet (uIP)</b>           | OSI Layer 4 (Transport)| Ensures error-free messages. Manages sequencing, losses, retries, and duplicates. |
 * | <b>RF24Ethernet (core)</b>          | OSI Layer 5 (Session)  | Establish, maintain, and terminate connections |
 * | <b>RF24Mesh</b> -Optional-     | OSI Layer 7 (Application)| Provides DHCP/DNS type protocols and allows dynamic addressing/topology for RF24Network.

 * @section News Update News
 * 
 * \version <b>1.51RC1 - Apr15-16 2015</b>
 * - Seemingly stable release candidate
 * - Major change: <a href="http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Gateway/">RF24Gateway</a> replaces RF24toTUN
 * - Now defaults to using RF24Mesh (TUN) interface 
 * - Apr 16 - Use external buffer for uIP to save memory. Requires Updating RF24Network and RF24Mesh.
 * 
 * See <a href="VersionInfo.html"> version history </a> for more info 
 * 
 * @section Config Configuration and Setup
 * 
 * See the <a href="ConfigAndSetup.html">Configuration and Set-Up</a> page for general installation and configuration information
 *  <br><br> 
 * @section BuildingANetwork Building a Network - Customizing your RF24 TCP/IP network
 * 
 * See the <a href="CustomNetworks.html">Building a network</a> page
 *  <br>  <br> 
 * @section Troubleshooting Troubleshooting
 *
 * The RF24 libraries are divided into layers, generally according to the OSI model, which allows specialized testing and troubleshooting of individual layers. 
 * <br>See the <a href=Troubleshooting.html >Troubleshooting</a> section for general troubleshooting steps.
 *  <br>  <br> 
 * @section AdditionalInfo Additional Information
 * 
 * **TAP vs TUN:**
 *
 * RF24Ethernet and RF24Gateway are able to utilize both TAP and TUN type interfaces. <br>
 * <b> TAP -</b> A TAP interface can be looked at much the same as an Ethernet interface, Ethernet headers are used to identify devices via MAC address, and the Address
 * Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to perform that identification. <br>
 * <b> TUN -</b> A TUN interface does not utilize Ethernet headers, MAC addresses or ARP, in this case relying on RF24Mesh/IP routing instead.
 *
 * **Limitations:**
 *
 * UDP frames can be up to 512 bytes in length, so UDP/DNS is limited by available memory, and the defined MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE / UIP_BUFFER_SIZE. If a 
 * DNS request exceeds the maximum allowed size, it will be dropped. DNS responses for addresses such as 'www.google.com' tend to be much smaller than requests
 * for 'google.com', and will generally work with the default configuration.
 *
 * **MAC address formatting:**
 *
 * RF24Ethernet uses a simple method of formatting the MAC addresses, using the first four bytes to store the characters 'RF24', and the last two bytes to store the
 * RF24Network address, which makes identification of nodes via MAC address very simple using standard monitoring tools.
 *
 * | RF24Network Address| Byte 0 | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | Byte 4 | Byte 5 |
 * |--------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
 * |      n/a           |   R    |   F    |   2    |   4    |Octal LB|Octal HB|
 * |      01            |  0x52  |  0x46  |  0x32  |   0x34 |  0x01  |  0x00  |
 * |      011           |  0x52  |  0x46  |  0x32  |   0x34 |  0x09  |  0x00  |
 * |      0443          |  0x52  |  0x46  |  0x32  |   0x34 |  0x23  |  0x01  |

 *
 *
 * @page ConfigAndSetup Configuration and Set-Up
 *
 * RF24Ethernet requires the RF24 and RF24Network_DEV libraries (optionally RF24Mesh) <br>
 * See http://tmrh20.github.io for documentation and downloads <br>
 *
 * See the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBAIqAaRu0g for a walk-through of the software setup with Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
 *  <br><br>
 *  <b> RPi </b>
 *
 * On the Raspberry Pi, a companion program, <a href="http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Gateway/">RF24Gateway</a> must be installed along with the RF24 and RF24Network libraries
 * 1. @code wget http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Installer/RPi/install.sh  @endcode  
 * 2. @code chmod +x install.sh  @endcode  
 * 3. @code ./install.sh  @endcode  
 * 4. @code cd RF24Gateway/examples/ncurses @endcode
 * 5. @code make @endcode
 * 6. @code sudo ./RF24Gateway_ncurses @endcode  
 * 7. The application will require the user to specify an IP address and Subnet Mask: 10.10.2.2 and 255.255.255.0 are the defaults with RF24Ethernet examples 
 * 8. Raspberry Pi defaults to the master node (00) using RF24Mesh. Secondary Raspberry pi nodes need to specify their RF24Network address or RF24Mesh nodeID.
 *   
 *<b> Arduino </b>
 * 1. For Arduino devices, the RF24, RF24Network and RF24Ethernet libraries need to be installed ( see http://tmrh20.github.io )
 * 2. Open the included Getting_Started_SimpleServer or Getting_Started_SimpleClient example
 * 3. Configure your chosen CE and CS pins for the radio connection.
 * 4. Configure the RF24Mesh nodeID (Any unique value from 3 to 255)
 * 5. Configure the IP address according to your preferences, (last octet must==nodeID) with the gateway set to the chosen IP of the RPi.
 * 6. Connect into your nodes web-server at http://ip-of-your-node:1000 from the RPi or configure the client sketch to connect to a server
 * running on the Raspberry Pi.
 * Note: To minimize memory usage on Arduino, edit RF24Network_config.h with a text editor, and uncomment #define DISABLE_USER_PAYLOADS. This
 * will disable standard RF24Network messages, and only allow external data, such as TCP/IP information. 
 *
 * <b> Non-Raspberry Pi (Linux etc) Devices </b><br>
 * Arduino can also function as a gateway for any Linux machine or PC/MAC that supports SLIP. <br>
 * See the SLIP_Gateway and SLIP_InteractiveServer
 * examples for usage without the need for a Raspberry Pi.
 * 
 * <b>Accessing External Systems: Forwarding and Routing</b>
 *
 * In order to give your network or nodes access to your network or the internet beyond the RPi, it needs to be configured to route traffic
 * between the networks.
 * 1. Run @code sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 @endcode to allow the RPi to forward requests between the network interfaces
 * 2. @code sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE @endcode to allow the RPi to perform NAT between the network interfaces <br>
 *
 * @note This configuration is generally for initial testing only. Users may also need to add a static route to their local machine, or configure port forwarding on the RPi.<br>
 * See the following links for more information on configuring and using IPTables:<br>
 * http://www.karlrupp.net/en/computer/nat_tutorial<br>
 * http://serverfault.com/questions/326493/basic-iptables-nat-port-forwarding
 *   
 * @warning <b>Note:</b> Users are responsible to manage further routing rules along with their IP traffic in order to prevent unauthorized access. 
 * 
 * @section Advanced Advanced (uIP) Configuration and Info
 *
 * See the <a href="group__UipConfiguration.html">User Configuration</a> section for modifying uip-conf.h
 *
 *
 *
 * @page CustomNetworks Building an RF24Ethernet Network
 * 
 * 
 * The general configuration instructions set up a basic sensor network, with static nodes, using TCP/IP over RF24Network. The layered 
 * library design also allows some nodes to communicate solely at the RF24Network level, creating hybrid networks to extend range over
 * large distances, or improve connectivity in distant areas.
 *
 *
 * @section RF24Mesh RF24Mesh Networks
 * 
 * RF24Mesh allows dynamic configuration of RF24Network addresses, and allows the creation of dynamic sensor networks. Nodes are able
 * to move around physically, releasing and renewing their RF24Network address as required. Once configured with a unique nodeID, nodes using RF24Mesh
 * can automatically configure themselves and join the network as required, with no user interaction.
 *
 * See the included <a href = SimpleServer_mesh_8ino-example.html>SimpleServer_Mesh</a> example for general usage and configuration information
 * with RF24Ethernet.
 *
 * **RF24Mesh** - Additional Information
 *
 * When utilizing RF24Mesh along with RF24Ethernet, relay/routing nodes should be configured with RF24Mesh, or designated on the master node as static nodes
 * with a pre-configured RF24Network address.
 *
 * RF24Mesh can be used with TAP/Ethernet configurations, but utilizing TUN/RF24Mesh together will reduce overhead.
 * 
 * See the links below for more information on utilizing RF24Mesh with RF24Ethernet and RF24Network.
 *
 * @section RF24Gateway RF24Gateway
 * 
 * See http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Gateway/ for more information on RF24Gateway
 *
 ** @section HybridNetworks Hybrid- RF24Network/RF24Ethernet Networks
 * 
 * The default configuration of RF24Ethernet and RF24Network enables both TCP/IP and the underlying messaging protocols provided by RF24Network.
 *
 * Relay/Routing nodes can be configured using only the RF24 and RF24Network layers (optionally RF24Mesh), and will automatically handle data
 * accordingly, whether it is an external data type (TCP/IP) or an internal network message from another RF24Network node. This allows very small and
 * inexpensive devices such as ATTiny to act as relay/routing nodes when extending network range and/or connectivity.
 *
 * Arduino/AVR devices can utilize custom or included sleep modes in RF24Network, and benefit from the lower power consumption and low-power features
 * of the nrf24l01 chips directly.
